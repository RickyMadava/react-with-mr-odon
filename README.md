# ðŸš€ Welcome to react with Mr Odon!

Here we will learn how to get familiar with the famous React framework.

ðŸ‘‰ Good training to all !

## Step 1: Creating a react project

In the terminal, create the react project with the following command

```sh
npx create-react-app react-with-mr-odon
```

We will then have a directory with the same name as the project with indications in terminal

```sh
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd react-with-mr-odon
  npm start

```
